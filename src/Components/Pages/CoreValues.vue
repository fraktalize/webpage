        <h2>Core values</h2>
        <p>
            All companies have core values, Jitesoft is no exception.<br>
            When it comes to open source projects, Jitesoft follows a fork of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1726742">Contributor Covenant</a>.
            The reason that we keep it as a fork is so that we can add additional information and rules, the base of the Contributor Covenant have been kept intact.<br><br>
            We love Open Source, and most projects developed that are not strictly for a customer or to-be-released project we try to release it under the MIT licence.<br>
            We try to not take on political and religious projects, but this is not a strict rule.<br>
            We are environment friendly and try to keep as much meetings as possible remote, that is, over the internet or phone.
